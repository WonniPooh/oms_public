# Binance Order Management Software

Software for managing position. Has API so can be connected to any kind of custom software.  At the moment supports connection to Binance FUTURES and can process  such orders:

<br />1. Market
<br />2. Limit
<br />3. Stop (Both market and limit)
<br />4. Custom OCO - Stop order and limit are exchanged depending on whether price is closer to limit or stop. Switch happens when price reaches 30% area (if total price delta between limit and stop order is considered as 100%)

Soon will be added Trailing order and Combined order -both custom functionality as long as a GUI tool to manually test provided functionality.
