# Binance Order Management Software

Self-develpoed software for managing order. Quite useful using along with strategies. At the moment supports FUTURES traiding for such orders:
1)Market
2)Limit
3)Stop (Both market and limit)
4)Custom OCO - Stop order and limit are changed depending on whether price is closer to limit or stop. Switch happens when price reaches 30% area (if total price delta between limit and stop order is considered as 100%)

Soon will be added Trailing order and Combined order -both custom functionality as long as a GUI tool to manually test provided functionality.
